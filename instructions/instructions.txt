You will be asked to decide on the size of the grid. 
Type a number to represent the number of columns or rows, and press Enter.

Then, you will be provided with the following prompt:


I have laid out my ships on the grid.
You now need to layout your two ships.
The first is two units long and the
second is three units long.
The grid has A1 at the top left and D4 at the bottom right.

Enter the squares for the two-unit ship:


At this point, you can enter coordinates indicating the placement of both ends of your ship.
For example, to place a ship on the coordinates A1 and A2, type and enter:

A1 A2

Once you have set the placement of your ships, the game will begin.

You will be prompted to enter a coordinate to fire on. If you hit the enemy ship,
your screen will display a H on that coordinate.

The enemy will then attempt to hit one of your ships. If the enemy hits your ship,
your screen will display a H on that coordinate.

Whoever sinks both of their enemy's ships is the winner!
